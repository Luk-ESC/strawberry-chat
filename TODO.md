# SBC+ (Strawberry Chat+)
If you are a relatively active user, you start with SBC+ Basic. The more activity, the higher the chance to get the "normal" SBC+. 
It will be a kind of level system, which counts and evaluates the messages of users, with random points. Sometimes less, sometimes more. 
Also, spamming is useless because you can only get points every 30s or so. How I do that I still have to think about. 
The introduction starts with v1.8.0, so the next version after v1.7.0.
