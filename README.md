The universal chatting platform for your terminal!

## What is Strawberry Chat?
Strawberry Chat is a simple chat platform based on Python TCP sockets. It allows you to chat with other people in a simple and minimal way - without annoying tracking and spying. 

## Why?
My goal was to develop a chat app for the terminal, which is not only minimal, but also useful. Strawberry Chat is actively developing and getting more and more features - and the best thing is, everything is free and stays free! 
In addition, Strawberry Chat is open source. This means that everyone can contribute to the project. Also, every user can create his own server if he/she wants to chat privately with his/her friends - we are happy about every single user and accept everyone with a warm heart! 

## Current state ![beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Beta_5_--_v1.7.0-success)
Currently, Strawberry Chat is being developed a lot, even almost daily. Currently we are in a middle **beta** stage. The big part already exists and Strawberry Chat is well usable, but there are still some things missing, ***including some admin commands, and very important bug fixes and security features, like encryption.***

## Disclaimer 
I don't want to see issues that talk about that encryption doesn't exist and how insecure it is.
**I am aware that this is not the most secure chat app. We are actively working on implementing encryption, but each developer finds this difficult in different ways.** 
### Please do not put pressure on us developers, we also have a private life. And yet we are actively working on the platform for you and for us! 

## FaQ
**Q:** Can I create my own client?<br>
**A:** Yes, of course! As long as this client adheres to our terms of use (currently in progress), you may use and actively develop it! Just create a fork (You can also upload the client file individually in a separate GitHub repo, just please ask first if this is okay!), and edit the client file as it suits you! But please still adhere to our terms of use! :)

**Q:** Can I host my own server?<br>
**A:** Yes!! Hosting your own servers is totally easy and no problem! You can even add your own commands for your friends or community, and change the texts as you like! Only if you upload this to GitHub or something else, you should please follow our terms of use and create a fork :)
