The universal chatting platform for your terminal!

## What is Strawberry Chat?
Strawberry Chat is a simple chat platform based on Python TCP sockets. It allows you to chat with other people in a simple and minimal way - without annoying tracking and spying. 

## Why?
My goal was to develop a chat app for the terminal, which is not only minimal, but also useful. Strawberry Chat is actively developing and getting more and more features - and the best thing is, everything is free and stays free! 
In addition, Strawberry Chat is open source. This means that everyone can contribute to the project. Also, every user can create his own server if he/she wants to chat privately with his/her friends - we are happy about every single user and accept everyone with a warm heart! 

## Current state ![State](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FStrawberry-Foundations%2Fstrawberry-chat%2Fmain%2Fapi%2Fjson%2Fversions.json&query=%24.stbchat.server.stable&label=%20&color=success) ![State](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FStrawberry-Foundations%2Fstrawberry-chat%2Fmain%2Fapi%2Fjson%2Fversions.json&query=%24.stbchat.server.dev&label=%20&color=success)
Currently, Strawberry Chat is being developed a lot, even almost daily. Currently we are in a end **beta** stage. The big part already exists and Strawberry Chat is very well usable, but there are still some things missing, ***including some commands, complete porting of all commands to the new command system and important bug fixes***

## Password Encryption/Hashing
Yes! Finally! Password encryption/hashing is here! With the release of v1.8.0pre1 the team has officially added password hashing. If security issues should arise, or bugs should occur, please open an issue! The system has already been tested, but not completely. Thanks :)

## FaQ
**Q:** Can I create my own client?<br>
**A:** Yes, of course! As long as this client adheres to our terms of use (currently in progress), you may use and actively develop it! Just create a fork (You can also upload the client file individually in a separate GitHub repo, just please ask first if this is okay!), and edit the client file as it suits you! But please still adhere to our terms of use! :)

**Q:** Can I host my own server?<br>
**A:** Yes. Hosting your own servers is totally easy! You can even add your own commands for your friends or community, and change the texts as you like! Only if you upload this to GitHub or something else, you should please follow our terms of use and create a fork :) We would be happy if you would chat with us on the official chat server :) The user experience is much better there
